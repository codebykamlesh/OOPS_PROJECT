### 📊 Data Management

* Data stored in CSV files:

  * `transactions.csv` → transaction history

---

### 🎨 UI Features

* Colored terminal interface
* Structured tables for accounts & transactions

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* C++
* STL (map, vector, stringstream, etc.)

## 🚀 How to Run

### 🔹 Compile

```

### 🔹 Run

```bash
./bank
```

## 🧠 How It Works

1. On start, choose:

   * Admin Login
   * Customer Access

2. Admin:

   * Must login
   * Gets full system control

3. Customer:

   * Enters account number
   * Can perform limited operations

## 🔥 Special Logic

### 🗑️ Account Deletion Rules

| User Type | PIN Required |
| --------- | ------------ |
| Admin     | ❌ No         |
| Customer  | ✅ Yes        |
